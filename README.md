Application for finding tourist attractions and facilities around Ukraine.  
Under development as part of the Kottans FE 2021 Course.

The application uses [OpenTripMap API](https://opentripmap.io/docs)

#### List of features:

1. Display of the list of tourist objects by regions
2. Display of information about an object, GPS coordinate, and link to Wikipedia
3. Search for an object in the list by name
4. Creating a list of favorite objects
5. Filtering the list by categories
6. Sorting the list of objects by rating and alphabet

The language of the application is Ukrainian, so among the data obtained from the API are selected only those whose names contain Cyrillic characters.
